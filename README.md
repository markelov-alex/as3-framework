# Napalm AS3 framework

Current public version exposed only for demonstration purposes as a part of portfolio. The code won't work because few packages were cut off being the most expensive parts of the library (preloader, resource and display). 

## ActionScript3 universal game framework for both Flash and Starling applications.

Napalm Framework is the 7th version of universal game framework since such an idea came to me in 2010. Over 5 years passed before it shapes the complete form. Since the very first version the library passed through a lot of transformations seeking for the best balance between flexibility and complexity. Now it seems that the best formula is found.
